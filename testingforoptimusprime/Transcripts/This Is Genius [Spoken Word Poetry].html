    <div><p>school sucks now don't get me wrong I believe everyone should have a general education but when I know how to solve quadratic equations with imaginary roots graphically and I'm not sure how that applies to life or better yet learn Cleopatra slept around but never heard the history of my own city you failed now I'm not trying to sound cruel but we live in a generation that would much rather smoke a joint than show up to school and to be honest I'm tired of placing all the blame on them I mean are we just pawns in a chess game waiting to accept their fate could the whole point of high school simply be just to graduate you tell us to follow our dreams but have a plan B and don't you see the more you try to protect the children in this way the more you reject the gifts they are trying to portray see school as a project when students never get the chance to project their abilities having to follow a curriculum and take required classes while stereotypically they could with high grades and glasses will make it in the college is more intelligent well how about the student who's ingenious inordinary innovative intellectual incalculable and wisdom is good intentions to change the world with his passion I believe educating him would be something along the lines of ineligible take a musician for example see to him a score on a math exam will never mean as much as the score in front of him why waste his time trying to count and measure when you can already count each measure with just a tap of his foot see this is genius watch as the bow grazes against the instrument and his fingers pluck and pull each string appropriately that creates a sound that just makes his body sway but if he's controlled by a bell that just rings I guess you could say the school was pulling his strings or how about the cook with only a seventh-grade reading level if his ingredient list is not written in MLA format I think you'll do just fine this is grammar matter when where you choose to dine is on the line and I'm not talking about margin but when it comes to margarine and butter he actually knows the difference he couldn't care less about the sophisticated words coming out of his mouth but more about the food going into yours see this is genius and if that doesn't fill the hunger games appetite you couldn't even think the grapes of wrath money some brilliance is as simplistic as hitting a ball it doesn't matter for science greatest in atrocity because I've never seen anyone spike a ball with so much strength decision and velocity and the only element she'd need know are those of speed and surprise but to a parent's eyes for to just a waste of time see this is genius practicing for so long she has a little time to study for chemistry the only question remaining is why can't you be more like your sister Emily what's the matter kind of ironic though cuz like life when it comes to school versus education everything's the matter putting children on an assembly line that has checkpoints where the only goal is to get us point A to point Z but if we only get to F then we failed plus our values and gifts are locked up in jail and why do we take tests to tell us we're wrong it's a number not my wife there's so much more to life than a grade in a book and what do you know if the SAT I just took because we all receive a number or grade if you will but our answers are locked up in vaults what's the point to learn or the thrill and common core won't solve anything so take a chill pill we are not here to memorize facts but figure our future and if the future holds taking a test to see who's the best I want no part in that there's a fact now while I'm speaking to adults I'm relating to the youth I'm not pointing out your faults but showing you the truth stop labeling us by standards and put us all in an even playing field but let us use our positions based on our passions values and where we can be proactive makes schooling less multiple choice and more interactive because maybe you're exponential at math but that's not how he functions because we all don't have the same mechanics or possibly you rock at science but in her opinion she'd rather not fill her head with space we're all sculpted in a different way all made with different values ideas and clay and if during my day they only offered opportunities continuity I can never get the chance to say I am genius you</p><p></p></div>
